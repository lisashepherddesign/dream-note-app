🌙 Dream Note

A serene, dream-logging web app built with vibe coding + AI assistance.

Dream Note is an ethereal, minimalist journaling application designed to help users capture their dreams, reflect on patterns, and explore deeper meaning through optional AI-powered analysis. This project blends intuitive UX design, Figma-driven visuals, and modern web development tools to create a calm, nighttime experience that supports reflection without overstimulation.

✨ Core Idea

What if dream journaling felt magical, effortless, and insightful?
Dream Note allows users to record their nightly dreams while giving them optional AI tools to uncover recurring emotions, symbols, and themes.

The design intentionally uses a dark-tempered, dream-like aesthetic to avoid bright stimuli that can interrupt the reflective mindset.
